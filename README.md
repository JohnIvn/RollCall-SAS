# RollCall Student Assistant System

RFID-Based Attendance Record Keeping System

"RollCall is a smart student assistant system that automates class attendance using RFID technology.
It provides fast, reliable, and accurate attendance tracking while reducing manual effort for instructors."

## ABOUT

RollCall is an RFID-powered attendance system built for schools and universities. It allows students
to check in by tapping their assigned RFID cards, with each entry securely logged and updated in real time.
